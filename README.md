## Description

The purpose of this website is to introduce myself to potential recruiters. 
In it, I describe my experience, education, interests or activities as a volunteer. 
In creating it, I used several programming technologies, and these are:

-HTML<br>
-CSS<br>
-JAVA SCRIPT<br>
-BEM convention<br>
-Normalize<br>
-ES6+ feature
 
Inside, I have inserted a table that describes my competences in the context of project management. 
I also used https://fonts.google.com/, from where I downloaded the Berkshire Swash font.
